1. Two sum issue.
    - If sorted, two pointers, otherwise, map.
    - If there are multiple solutions? Likes [2, 2, 7, 11, 15, 7], target 9?
        - Sort and two pointers. (Unique solutions?)

2. Linked list issue.

3. Longest substring issue. (Longest subarray issue)
    - Sliding window, two pointers.
        - Current window satisfy conditions, move right pointer to extend the length of window, and update the info of window.
        - Otherwise, move left pointer and update current window info.
    - Similar issues, largest sum of subarray?

4. Binary search issue.
    - Sorted array and find a value in O(log(n))? Binary search in mind.
    - We can eliminate 1/2 subarray from either array a or array b each time.

5. Longest substring issue and palindromic issue.
    - Sliding window, two pointer, but in this problem, we sliding left and right in different direction.
    - Palindromic problem, the difference between odd and even? aba and abba.
    - Time complexity: O(n * n) and space complexity O(1)

    - Alternative solution, DP.
        - Overlapping subproblems and optimal substructures, likes a, bab, cbabc, dcbabcd, if f(m, n) is palindromic,
        and if char[m - 1] == char[n + 1], f(m - 1, n + 1) is palindromic too.

6. Math

7. Integer reverse. Math

9. Palindromic issue.
    - Even and Odd situations, likes 1221 and 12321.
    - If it's palindrome, left half == reverse(right half)(12 == reverse(21)) or left half / 10 == reverse(right half)
    - Corner case, the number % 10 == 0

10. String match issue, think about how Levenstein distance or longest common substring works? DP in mind.
    - Has overlapping subproblems and optimal substructures.
    - 2D DP problem, initial DP matrix.

11. Two pointers issue.

14. String issue.

15. Three sum issue.
    - Sort.
    - Traversal element one by one, skip same elements since required unique.

16. Three sum issue.

17. DFS or backtracking.

19. Linked List.
    - Find the nth node from end of linkedlist?

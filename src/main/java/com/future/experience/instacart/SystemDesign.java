/**
 * Problem
 *
 * At Instacart, we have customers that place orders on our website, and we hire personal shoppers whose job it is to go to grocery stores to fulfill those orders.
 *
 * We give credit cards to our shoppers so they can purchase groceries for orders we've assigned them. Our servers receive an HTTP request from our payment
 * processor every time a shopper swipes the credit card that we give them. The payload looks like this:
 *
 * {
 *     shopper_id:  123，
 *     amount: 300,
 *     merchant: {
 *         name: "Target",
 *         address: "123 Main St"
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * When we receive the HTTP request, we have to synchronously respond within 1 second with a 200 OK to approve the transaction or 402 Payment Required to decline the transaction.
 *
 * Say you are hired tomorrow, and you're leading the three person team in this room.  How would you suggest we build the application that processes these requests?
 * Some areas we should be sure to cover are *physical infrastructure, data stores, data model, security, and performance considerations*.  
 * For simplicity, we should start off with the assumption that 1 Shopper has just 1 Order at 1 merchant.
